## Log

### 2026-08-30 - working tree
Named and structured the product as a pnpm and Turborepo monorepo with separate frontend, backend, design-system, and Effect domain modules. Recorded the component-first Convex decision and selected Convex static hosting (`package.json`, `turbo.json`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/adr/0001-component-first-convex.md`).

### 2026-08-30 - isolated Convex backend
Created a new Rantau project in the Nakafa team, provisioned its Europe development deployment, and verified it does not target the existing Nakafa project. Mounted Agent, Firecrawl, AgentMail, Rate Limiter, and Static Hosting components. Added Convex Auth v2 keys, source-backed job discovery, direct application URL pinning, readiness plans, profile and PDF CV processing, application tracking, and AgentMail inbox and digest flows. Domain tests pass with 100 percent statement, function, and line coverage and 96 percent branch coverage (`packages/backend/convex`, `packages/domain`).
